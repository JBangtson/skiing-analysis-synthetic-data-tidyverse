# Synthetic Ski Data Analysis ⛷
This report utilized two modeling techniques, multiple linear regression and decision trees, to analyze the factors influencing the number of runs a skier completes during their ski trip. The initial section of the report evaluated the multiple linear regression (MLR) model’s performance. The MLR model demonstrated proficiency in predicting the number of runs, accounting for approximately 82% of the variance. Subsequently, a decision tree was employed to further investigate the variables affecting the skier’s run count. Analysis of the mean absolute error (MAE) suggested an average prediction error of around two runs, consistent with the trend observed in the MLR model’s R2 value. Finally, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models were compared which showed that the multiple linear regression model predicted the variance of the runs better than the decision tree model.
